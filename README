Put different info on the participants listing.

Avoid columns that don't provide any information
- don't waste 2 columns displaying info about the event when you are displaying the participants of an event 
- don't display 2 price related columns if the events are free

- add the country and organisation in the listing
- provide a way to search fast in the list of participants (eg all the Dave, the ones from france...)
- to change the status (ajax)
- and generate a name badge directly
